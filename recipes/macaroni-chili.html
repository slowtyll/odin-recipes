    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The coziness of pasta and chilli, all in one recipe. Protein-packed with both a soy veggie ground and kidney
        beans. Batch-make this recipe to enjoy in the coming days, and it's a recipe that freezes rather well too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g dry whole wheat macaroni</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>400 g canned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp canned tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 vegetable bouillon cube</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>315 g cooked red kidney beans</li>
        <li>170 g soy veggie ground</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>90 g fresh spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook macaroni according to package directions, but decrease cooking time by 1 - 2 minutes. Once nearly al
            dente, drain.</li>
        <li>While noodles are boiling, heat the oil in a large pot on medium-high heat and saut√© the onions and garlic
            until the onions are soft, about 3 - 5 minutes. Add splashes of water as needed to deglaze the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, and rinse out the can with water (about 400 mL) adding this to the pot as well,
            along with the tomato paste, bouillon cube, and spices. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once bubbling away, add the kidney beans, soy ground, carrot, and bell pepper. Cook until the carrots are
            soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add the drained noodles and spinach. Cook for another minute, or until the spinach wilts and the
            pasta is al dente. Serve with desired garnish, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
